### Installation

This is a [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) application, so you'll need to know a bit of Ruby-Fu to get it working. There are a couple of dependencies:

* ImageMagickÂ® and GraphicsMagick image processing libraries **must** be installed, and
* You **must** have a [url2png](http://url2png.com/) account (please set the `api_key` and `private_key` environment variables).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/leereilly/ogre.git
cd ogre
bundle install
ruby ogre.rb
```
